NumPy Project

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **5 hands-on NumPy projects** designed to help beginners and intermediate users strengthen their **numerical computing skills**. Each project focuses on real-world scenarios and teaches core NumPy concepts such as **arrays, vectorized calculations, reshaping, statistical analysis, and data manipulation**.

By the end of these 5 projects, you will have a strong foundation in using **NumPy** for data analysis, simulations, and basic analytics tasks.
