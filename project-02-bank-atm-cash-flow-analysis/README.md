# 💰 ATM Cash Flow Simulation – NumPy Project

## 📌 Overview
This project uses NumPy to simulate and analyze cash deposits and withdrawals from a bank ATM for 30 consecutive days.  
The goal is to understand spending patterns and cash flow trends using numerical techniques.

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. Created two NumPy arrays:
   - Daily deposits (₹5,000 – ₹40,000)
   - Daily withdrawals (₹3,000 – ₹35,000)
2. Computed daily balance using vectorized operations.
3. Identified:
   - highest deposit day
   - highest withdrawal day
   - best balance day
   - worst negative balance day
4. Calculated weekly net cash flow and detected the week with highest earnings.
5. Counted:
   - days with overspending
   - days with high remaining balance (> ₹10,000)
